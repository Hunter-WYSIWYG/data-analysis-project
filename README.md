# Information Retrieval and Visualization - Africa Conflicts 1997-2021

This project was created for the Course "Information Retrieval and Visualization" at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. The repository contains the code and the corresponding paper for an interactive web application that visualizes data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project about every documented conflict in Africa from 1997 until 2021.

## How to use

The repository contains an Elm project. To execute the web app you have to run Elm Reactor in the repository and then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser. The user can put together a set of geographical regions with the filter on the right side of the main view. This way, a data point gets displayed in the middle graph with its corresponding fatality count and year for every documented conflict in this region. It is possible to click single-year columns in this graph view to display more information about the events of this particular year in a parallel coordinates view.

## Technologies
